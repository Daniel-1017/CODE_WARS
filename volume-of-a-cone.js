Find the volume of a cone whose radius and height are provided as parameters to the function volume. Use the value of PI provided by your language (for example: Math.PI in JS, math.pi in Python or Math::PI in Ruby) and round down the volume to an Integer.

If you complete this kata and there are no issues, please remember to give it a ready vote and a difficulty rating. :)
