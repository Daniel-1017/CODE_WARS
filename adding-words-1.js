This is the first part of this kata series. Second part is here and third part is here

Add two English words together!

Implement a class Arith (struct struct Arith{value : &'static str,} in Rust) such that

  //javascript
  var k = new Arith("three");
  k.add("seven"); //this should return "ten" 
Input - Will be between zero and ten and will always be in lower case

Output - Word representation of the result of the addition. Should be in lower case
