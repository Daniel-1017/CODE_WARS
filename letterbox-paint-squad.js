/* 
Kata Task
Given the start and end letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted.

Example
For start = 125, and end = 132

The letterboxes are

125 = 1, 2, 5
126 = 1, 2, 6
127 = 1, 2, 7
128 = 1, 2, 8
129 = 1, 2, 9
130 = 1, 3, 0
131 = 1, 3, 1
132 = 1, 3, 2
The digit frequencies are:

0 is painted 1 time
1 is painted 9 times
2 is painted 6 times
etc...
and so the method would return [1,9,6,3,0,1,1,1,1,1]

Notes
0 < start <= end
In C, the returned value will be free'd.

  while (start <= end) {
    for (let i of start.toString()) {
      hash[i]++;
    }
    start++;
  }
  return [...Object.values(hash)];
};
